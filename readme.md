# Handwritten Digit Recognition using GAN
This project demonstrates the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate and recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of two neural networks - a generator and a discriminator - that are trained together in an adversarial manner. The generator learns to create realistic-looking handwritten digits, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real images from the MNIST dataset and fake images generated by the generator.
